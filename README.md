# Personal site for Chris van Wagoner  

Pulled together from half-finished/in-progress work from another git repo and put here.  
This is a static HTML site, built with [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass), and Flexbox, written (to the best of my ability) using the [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) naming convention.

It also uses the following projects for animation:
[Wow.js](), [Animate.css](), [Anime.js](), and a little bit of CSS Keyframes and jQuery.
